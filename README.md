#Useful JavaScript libraries and scripts to help enhance/create ajax / SPA (Single Page Apps)

The libraries included here intend to be small, self-contained, useful libs with either 0 dependencies or at most depend only on:

  * [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) (3KB packed and Gzipped) and
  * [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) (3.9KB packed and Gzipped) .

Their small footprint should make it an easy drop-in for any javascript-enabled page that needs it.

This aims to be a high quality collection of JavaScript or [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) scripts striving to be developed with the same elegance and ethos as [@jashkenas](http://twitter.com/jashkenas) excellent work.

We hope to invite other contributors who love JavaScript and writing Ajax applications. 
Feel free to extend, enhance or provide any other positive contribution you like to.
